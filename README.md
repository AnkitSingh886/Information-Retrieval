# Information-Retrieval
Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of data structures to manage and retrieve data efficiently. The system is built using C programming and employs structures like hash tables, linked lists, and arrays to store and retrieve key-value pairs. The project demonstrates how various data structures can be used to optimize the performance of information retrieval systems.

Key Features:
Key-Value Pair Storage: Efficiently store data using hash tables, with linked lists ensuring seamless data retrieval.
Dynamic Data Insertion: Users can dynamically insert new data entries into the system without affecting the existing data structure.
Data Retrieval: The system allows users to search for stored data using specific keys, ensuring quick and accurate data access.
How to Execute the Project

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsc-project.git](https://github.com/AnkitSingh886/Information-Retrieval
cd dsc-project

Step 2: Compile the Program
Use a C compiler to compile the source code. If youâ€™re using GCC, run:bash
gcc -o data_retrieval data_retrieval.c

Step 3: Run the Program
After compiling, run the executable:
./data_retrieval

Step 4: Interact with the Program
You will be presented with a menu-driven interface. Follow these steps:

Data Retrieval: Select option 1 to search for a key and retrieve its associated data.
Add Key and Data: Select option 2 to add new key-value pairs to the system. Follow the prompts to enter the key and the associated data.
Step 5: Continue or Exit
You can continue interacting with the system by selecting the options provided in the menu. To exit, choose the appropriate option when prompted.
